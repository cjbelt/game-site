            <h1>Why VR flopped?</h1>
            <p>Virtual Reality is always considered one of the most promising technologies of the future, not only in gaming. But the future never comes, as VR headsets and applications are still not popular. What's wrong with VR, after all?</p>

                <h2>VR tools are expensive</h2>
                <p>VR headsets and a PC powerful enough to support VR games are expensive. Even the entry-level models are not that cheap. This high costs stop the popularization of VR.</p>

                <h2>VR still has limitations</h2>
                <p>VR experience still has problems. First, games and applications are very basic compared to the regular consoles and PC games. The developers need to adapt the game to the VR setup resources and gameplay mode, which is very simple until now.</p>
                <p>Also, VR isn't a confortable enough experience, because the weight of the headset and the head spinning, effect of long uses.</p>
                <p>Finally, the compatibility between VR platforms are very low. You can't play a PS VR game in a Oculus Quest, for example. This forces users to change the headset and buy new ones often, increasing the costs.</p>
