            <h1>Why this is the worst gaming generation in decades</h1>
            <p>We're living a bad era for the videogames. I think this is unquestionable. It's hard to cite a remarkable game of this generation. A few games are good, it's worth playing. But most of them are dull, boring, poorly made.</p>
            <p>Maybe the problem is with me: I'm getting too old (or too grumpy) for videogames. But I have some arguments to prove that. Here's some reasons that generation sucks:</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Consoles and games are expensive</h2>
                <p>In many countries, consoles are too expensive, because of the taxes, import costs and the national currency value. This puts many players away from the market. Consoles are losing one of the main advantages over PC: being relatively cheap.</p>
                <p>The games also are getting too expensive. Any simple game are sold as a AAA launch. Game companies are overestimating their works. I think the main example of this generation is the GTA Trilogy: Definitive Edition, which I'll describe more in the next reason.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Current games are badly made</h2>
                <p>Game developers are increasingly less time to make a game. Companies press them to finish the project fastly. Unfortunately, sometimes they don't have time to polish the design and fix some bugs. The result is shameful: how can a big developer such as EA, Ubisoft and Rockstar Games build a game so badly made?</p>
                <p>I think the GTA Trilogy is the most remarkable example of the last years: Rockstar sold it as the definitive experience of playing the classic trilogy of the series: improved graphics, better gameplay and adapted for the current gen,a truly AAA game, sold at $59.99 in its launch.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, we all know how the game was launched: buggy, badly shaped characters, badly optimized. The game never completely solved this issues until now.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Microtransactions</h2>
                <p>The games are more and more offering extra products to improve your experience: coins, skins, new characters, an entirely new story, etc. The games' algorithms are built to convince the players to buy new products inside the game (which are called pay-to-win games).</p>
                <p>I'm not totally against that kind of practice, but it's becoming abusive: the companies are focusing on implement that kind of system to increase the profits rather than improve the game quality.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Why the game companies continue to make these mistakes?</h2>
                <p>Because they're still selling a lot! GTA The Trilogy, for example, sold an estimated 10 million copies since its release, according to the CEO of Take Two, Strauss Zelnick. Fifa, another game famous for its microtransactions, are between the most sold games of the year.</p>
                <p>Apparently, people don't care too much about microtransactions, bad design or any other bad things in the games. Or, maybe they still hope that the incoming games will be better than the previous ones. The fact is the modern strategy by the developers work, and they will continue adopting while it works.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What we can do to stop that?</h2>
                <p>I think that movement of bad choices in the game industry will continue for some years. But we, the customers, can make something to accelerate its end.</p>
                <p>I think the best way (and most painful for some) is not buying abusive games. Remember, they still do these things because they work. A sales decrease would sign the companies to rethink about their strategies.</p>
                <p>Also, is important to support smaller developers that make good games. Consider add more indy games on your library!</p>
